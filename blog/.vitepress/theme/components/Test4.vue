            Hi! I&apos;m Stefanos. I&apos;m the father of a sweet boy called Leo
            and I&apos;m currently working as a Senior Frontend Developer at
            Fedex where we work to deliver an innovative shipping solution to our global users. I
            love talking about frontend architecture, state machines, reactive
            programming and Angular.
